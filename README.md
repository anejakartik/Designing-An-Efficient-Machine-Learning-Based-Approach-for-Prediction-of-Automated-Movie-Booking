# Designing An Efficient Machine Learning Based Approach for Prediction of Automated Movie Booking:-

Application Name - BoxOffice

Box-Office is project designed to book movie tickets or shows according customer preference and to make customer experience better.

This project is developed to make customer experience better and growth in theatre tickets sale

## Getting Started

## 1) BoxOfficeppt

A PowerPoint Application to breifly explain the current senario of Movie booking System and also discuss the possibility of improvement with the Machine Learning.

It contains proposed methodology and designs for applications in devlopment.

## 2) UML Diagrams

It is Design developed in order to visually understand the flow of Appliction.
 
Uml Diagram contains Class Diagram, Use Case Diagram and sequence diagram etc.


## 3) Machine Learning Analysis

It is the Exploratory Data Analysis of dataset provided by Netflix On Kaggle.com .

Datset contains details of the movie titles added by NetFlix Till November 2019.

This Folder contains :

i) Dataset - netflix_titles_nov_2019.csv 

ii)netflix-shows-and-movies-exploratory-analysis.ipynb - It contains the Exploratory Data Analysis of dataset provided by netflix.

iii)netflix-movie-recommendation .ipynb - 
On the basis Of results of netflix-shows-and-movies-exploratory-analysis.ipynb a recomendation algorithms is applied in netflix-movie-recommendation


## 4) BoxOffice Django Application:-

With help of Results obtained by Machine Learning Analysis a project is built on django to implement movie recommendation.

This appliction contains: 

-> Project Requirements.txt - Dependencies required to run the application.(command line - pip install -r  Project Requirements.txt)

-> Boxoffice.sql - It is the DataBase file for running the storage of data.(should be installed in xampp)

-> Other (Boxoffice,Movie,user etc)- These folder contain the codes for working of application.

Project Running command - python manage.py runserver

## 5) Implementation Images

It contains the images for working of BoxOffice Dango Application and Machine Learning Analysis.
